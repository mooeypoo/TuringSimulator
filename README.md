# TuringSimulator
A JS simulator for Turing Machiens

This is a script I wrote when I was first year in CS Masters, after learning about Turing Machines (which are one of my favorite subjects)-- the code is a mess, and the site has some issues right now with session data.

In the spirit of open source'ness, I'm sharing this, but do be kind when you look at it... I may pick it up again and fix it up.

Demo is up here (slightly broken while I work on things): http://moriel.smarterthanthat.com/apps/turing/
